    "The simple task schedular was sorting through a number of tasks and scheduling tasks with fixed times at their given times, however it did not take into consideration the utility obtained from each task and hence was not an optimal algorithm for scheduling tasks. Its scheduling abilities were based on the dependencies, i.e., a task was performed if it has no dependencies and did it serially but following the order of the inputs.  This allowed for very restricted inputs that made the algorithm inflexible and inapplicable to different situations. We could not add a new task with high priority into the list and expect it to be scheduled accordingly. \n",
    "Moreover, since the algorithm didn‚Äôt schedule the tasks based on their utility, there was no way of expressing the significance of the task or the costs associated with it. The priority of the task should be dependent on not just our preferences but also real-world costs that can be expressed numerically and represented in our schedular. \n",
    "Lastly, it did not consider an upper bound (end of the day) and hence could not schedule tasks optimally within that bound. If we can only fit x number of tasks in a day, the schedular should choose the tasks that give the highest utility to be considered optimal. \n",

This allows us to sort them easily as heaps are an effective and efficient way of sorting tasks as compared methods such as like sorting. They also makes retrieval of tasks much easier as we just need to extract the root node in order to get the task with the highest priority.\n",

    "Classes: three classes have been implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "MaxHeap: class that has the attributes and methods needed for the heap.\n",
    "Task class: takes the list input and compiles them into a formate we can work with in our schedular. It only has attributes and no functionality as it is just used for converting the input into the required formate.\n",
    "TaskScheduler class: has the main functionality of the algorithm in its methods.\n",
    "The Task and the Task Schedular class created separately because they offer easy maintenance of the code. Changes to the TaskScheduler class do not affect the way the input is given and the Task class makes it easier to change the way a certain input is percieved by the algorithm which was very useful especially when two different implementations of the greedy algorithm approach were done as it allowed versatility of approaches with respect to the utility value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption we make here is that the user of the algorithm has knowledge of the perceived costs and benefits associated with each activity. Since this is the overarching fundamental concept, without this, the algorithm is useless. If the user is unable to comprehend this principle, they might end up performing tasks that could be highly inefficient, have low aggregate profit values, or processes that are extremely costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second assumption is that the user understands the limited nature of the resource of time, and knows that some tasks might exceed the set threshold and the tasks might be ignored or removed. The user needs to take note of this and take measures to ensure that any task missed by the algorithm is in the users' knowledge.  For example, if a compulsory class is being skipped by the algorithm and user takes note of it then they can go back and tweak the profits and costs associated."

    "#### Analysis of the test case\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The above list of tasks are an example of how the the two greedy algorithms can run differently depending on the input that is given. Our initial test cases for the two, with the schedule of a day as an input, showed how using the integer-utility value for priority calculations gave a combination with higher aggregate utility, this test shows the opposite. That is because both of the greedy approaches are valid and aim for an optimal schedular, but one algorithm can perform better for particular inputs as compared to others. Here, using utility/minute allowed the schedular to choose tasks that took less time and hence could fit 9 tasks in a day as compared to 8 that using integral utilities could. \n",
    "This input measured just the profit calculation of the two, without consideration of whether tasks could be multi-tasked or fixed in order to show a comparision of just how the optimal profit can change with a different input. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Another example of how the schedular works as expected is that is takes into consideration an upper bound, a value of n within which all possible tasks can be done. This value of n can be specificed by the user given how much time they have in a day to schedule their tasks. I used a baseline value corresponding to the end of the day (12:00 am) as my value of n.

If it is lower, it takesn the previous value in that position too. Hence, when it reaches the end of the table, the table[n][m] value is the highest possible value, giving us the final output that we use."

    "The data structures were used in the dynamic programming task scheduler are heaps, classes, and tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Heaps are implemented to sort the tasks based on the priority that they have. This allows us to sort them easily as heaps are an effective and efficient way of sorting tasks as compared methods such as like sorting. They also makes retrieval of tasks much easier as we just need to extract the root node in order to get the task with the highest priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Classes: three classes have been implemented. \n",
    "- MaxHeap: class that has the attributes and methods needed for the heap. \n",
    "- Task class: takes the list input and compiles them into a formate we can work with in our schedular. It only has attributes and no functionality as it is just used for converting the input into the required formate.\n",
    "- TaskScheduler class: has the main functionality of the algorithm in its methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Task and the Task Schedular class created separately because they offer easy maintenance of the code. Changes to the TaskScheduler class do not affect the way the input is given and the Task class makes it easier to change the way a certain input is percieved by the algorithm which was very useful especially when two different implementations of the greedy algorithm approach were done as it allowed versatility of approaches with respect to the utility value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Table were used to get the best possible value of profit. The table looks at all the combinations of tasks calculates the profit of each combination, comparing them to get a final value that is the highest value in the bottom right position of the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions:\n",
    "In dynamic programming, certain assumptions are made. The first of these is that the timeline for the tasks performed is not defined. This is efficient because it uplifts the constraints of scheduling tasks in a particular order or at a specific time, as observed in certain fixed cases of greedy algorithms. This helps the algorithm decide the best course of action for the intended user.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also make the assumption is that there is no multitasking between the tasks because if the users tend to multitask then the algorithm might output different results than the calculated ones because the users might or might not be efficient at multitasking and therefore it can go either way from the maximum possible output value. This assumption stands because, while dynamic programming gives the most optimal solutions, it does not add solutions together or run them at the same time, which would be the in silico equivalent of multitasking. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another assumption present here is that the user who has decided the activities that need to be put in has an elaborate knowledge of the costs and benefits of each activity. A cost could be defined as the amount of money spent on an activity. For example, using a public court for playing basketball has no negative cost because the court is free and within walking range of the residence. However, going to a shopping mall and buying goods will have a negative cost in terms of money spent because the goods are exchanged for money which decreases the bank balance. Since there is an element of happiness in going shopping and buying the goods that are necessary, it can be thought of as a payoff between the amount spent on the goods and the procurement of necessary goods and the happiness associated with it. We can use these to decide whether the gain outweighs the expenditure."
